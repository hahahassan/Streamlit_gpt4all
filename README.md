# Digit Recognition App

This Streamlit app allows users to draw a single digit (0-9) using their mouse and predicts the digit using a trained machine learning model. The backend uses PCA and Logistic Regression to perform the prediction based on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Canvas for Drawing**: An interactive canvas where users can draw digits.
- **Digit Prediction**: The app predicts the drawn digit and displays the result.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes PCA for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression for classification.
